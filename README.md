# SimUnity2
Attempt at a reimplementation of The Sims 2 Ultimate Collection in the Unity Engine...

As of the writing of this, Neighborhood select and Neighborhood View are working. Lot view, SimAntics and skeleton import are just some of the next steps... Oh and music code that doesn't suck and actually manages to play the next song.

The code is a pretty big mess but, it's a good starting point for something greater, even if not a full reimplementation of TS2.

# Usage:
Write the appropiate paths to your TS2 Directories and user data folders in config.json and paste it into the root folder of the project or in the same spot as the built .exe
